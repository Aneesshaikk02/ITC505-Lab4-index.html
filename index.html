<section id="Cloud Computing: An Overview">
    <h1>Cloud Computing: An Overview</h1>
    <p>Cloud computing is a paradigm that has revolutionized the way computing resources are accessed, delivered, and managed. It offers a flexible and scalable model for users to access applications, storage, and computing power over the internet. This paper explores the key concepts, advantages, and challenges associated with cloud computing.</p>
</section>
<section id="Key Concepts">
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing is characterized by several key concepts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Demand Self-Service:</strong> Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed without human intervention from the service provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Broad Network Access:</strong> Services are accessible over the network and can be accessed through various devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Pooling:</strong> Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Elasticity:</strong> Resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned to scale out or in based on demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Measured Service:</strong> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section id="Advantages of Cloud Computing">
    <h2>Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing offers numerous advantages to individuals and businesses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Users pay for the resources they use, leading to cost savings compared to traditional on-premise infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance without over-provisioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Cloud services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, providing flexibility for users.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Cloud providers often offer high levels of reliability and redundancy, reducing the risk of data loss or service downtime.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section id="Addendum">
    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>As part of styling the text-heavy page, several choices were made to enhance readability and visual appeal. Below are the explanations for the stylistic choices:</p>
    <h3>Font Choices:</h3>
    <p>The font family selected for the body text is Arial, which is a widely used sans-serif font known for its readability on screens. This choice aims to ensure the content is easily legible across various devices and screen sizes.</p>
    <h3>Sizes of Headings and Main Text:</h3>
    <p>Heading sizes were carefully chosen to establish a clear hierarchy. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used for the main title to indicate its significance, while <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags are used for section titles. The main text size is set to 16px to maintain a balance between readability and content density.</p>
    <h3>Color Choices:</h3>
    <p>The color scheme incorporates shades of green and blue for headings and text to create visual contrast and improve readability. Green (#009688) and blue (#4CAF50) were chosen for headings to differentiate them from the body text (#333) while maintaining consistency.</p>
    <h3>Margin and Padding Choices:</h3>
    <p>Consistent margin and padding values were applied throughout the document to ensure adequate spacing between elements and improve visual clarity. Margins and paddings were adjusted based on the content hierarchy to maintain a balanced layout.</p>
    <h3>HTML Abuse:</h3>
    <p>In the original HTML content, some elements were chosen based on visual appearance rather than semantic meaning. For example, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags were used for section titles instead of <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags. This was corrected to align with proper HTML semantics.</p>
    <p>The revisions were aimed at improving accessibility, readability, and semantic correctness while maintaining a visually appealing layout.</p>
